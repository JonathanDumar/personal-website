    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
        My name is Jonathan Dumar, and I am an honors student studying management information systems
        and pursuing a master's degree in management information technology
        at the University of Oklahoma. Through my past experiences working
        as a book designer and typesetter, I have learned not only how to
        handle large complex projects but also how to cooperate and communicate
        effectively with both collaborators and executives.
